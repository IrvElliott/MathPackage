<p>CORRELATION</p>
<p>When some square matrix operations are performed on a computer, a problem may
occur when one row is a multiple or equal of another. For example, for a set of
simultaneous equations, one such row can be multiplied then subtracted from the
other and the system would then have a zero row and the problem would be
unsolvable. A similar problem may occur if a row or column is almost a multiple
of another. This may causes a numeric overflow an attempt to form a number that
is too large to represent in the computer's system. An attempt to find the
inverse of such a matrix will fail. Such a matrix is called
&quot;singular&quot;, which is another way of saying it is bad.</p>

<p>To check for these conditions, we can calculate the &quot;correlation
coefficient&quot; for each combination of two columns. As was explained in the
VECTOR discussions in this document, the dot product of
two vectors of dimension two or three produces a result of |A|*|B|*cos(theta),
where theta is the angle between them. When the dot product of two vectors of
dimension greater than three is formed, the result is considered to be
|A|*|B|*C, where C is the correlation coefficient. Like the cosine, the value
ranges from 0 to 1. If the value is 1, the two vectors are multiples of, or
equal to, each
other; if the value is 0, they are said to be &quot;orthogonal&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If one performs experiments, such as upon mixtures of ingredients, it is
advisable to form an m by n matrix of the amounts of ingredients, where m is the
number of mixtures and n is the number of&nbsp; different ingredients. One can
then multiply the transpose of that matrix by the matrix then divide each
element by the absolute values of the columns to give a matrix of correlation
coefficients, as follows:</p>

<p>For a perfect case, in which all of the X column vectors are orthogonal to
each other, the n by n matrix and the correlation matrix would be as follows:</p>
