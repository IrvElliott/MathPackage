<p>CONTOUR PLOTTING</p>
<p>Contour lines can be used if there is a need for a map showing&nbsp; how some
measurable quantity is spread over a surface. For example, a weather map showing
temperatures or air pressure over an area. The input for the contour line
plotter described here must be in the form of a matrix. If the original data is
in the form of a map with measurements taken at points scattered throughout an
area, the the measurements must be interpolated to be in matrix form. For
example, if there are 100 scattered temperature measurements to be represented
by a 20 by 25 matrix, interpolation must be used to determine the temperature at
each of the 500 matrix elements.</p>
<p>The process first reads the matrix and determines the maximum and minimum
values and the range (maximum-minimum). Next, a loop is performed to determine a
plotting interval that will result in a reasonable number of contour line
values; at least 4 and no more than 10. Each test chooses an interval value of
the form 1, 2 or 5 times 10 to some integer power. Some examples: 1,&nbsp;
2,&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 10, 20, 5*10^3.</p>
<p>Next, lines are drawn to represent the matrix as a squared-off rectangle. For
example, a&nbsp; 20 by 25 matrix would&nbsp; show as an array of 19 by 24
squares.</p>
<p>Next, for each contour increment and for each square, the process examines
each of the four sides to see if the contour value lies between the matrix
values at each end of the side. If the value is in range for two sides, a point
on each side having the contour increment is determined by interpolation and a
line is drawn between the two points. If three sides pass the test, two lines
are drawn as a &quot;V&quot;. If all four pass, two crossing lines are drawn. </p>
<p>If different colors can be used for printing, each unique valued contour line
is of a different color.&nbsp; </p>
