<p>The following is an example to help the reader to understand the four-tape
sort. </p>
<p>Imagine that you have a shuffled deck of playing cards and that you wish to
sort them in order Ace through King. Assume that the value of Ace is 1, Jack is
11, Queen is 12, King is 13 and the rest are whatever number is on the card. In
front of you is a table with room for two piles of cards positioned as follows:</p>
<p>A&nbsp; B</p>
<p>1. Hold the deck face down, deal one card&nbsp; face-up to position A. Next,
perform the following, step 2, until all the cards have been dealt:</p>
<p>2. Deal out one card. If it is equal or greater than the previously dealt
card, place it face-upon the same pile as the previous card.&nbsp; If it is
less, place it on the other position. </p>
<p>At this point, each pile A or B will contain a number of sub-sequences that
are each sorted. The average sub-sequence will be about two or three cards. Make
room for positions C and D, as follows:</p>
<p>A&nbsp; B</p>
<p>C&nbsp; D</p>
<p>Now, perform steps 3 and 4 repeatedly until all of the cards are in one pile.</p>
<p>3. Move piles A and B to positions C and D, face down.</p>
<p>4. Turn up one card and place on pile A. Next, perform step 5 repeatedly.</p>
<p>5. Turn over a card from both piles C and D. </p>
<p>6. From the cards on C and D, chose a card that is equal or higher than the
previously selected, but lower than the other card. Place that card onto the
same pile A or B as the previously placed card. If neither the C or D card
qualifies, place the lowest or equal of the two onto the other pile B or A. Turn
over the next card of the pile that was previously taken.</p>
