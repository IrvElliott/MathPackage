<p>PYTHAGORIAN THEOREM</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Wizard of Oz movie, the scarecrow says, &quot;The square on the
hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the two adjacent sides!&quot;.
Of course, this is the Pythagoras theorem. In my youth, I remember being
presented with the following illustration as a sort of proof of that theorem:</p>

<p>The actual proof is based upon ratios. If one takes a right triangle and
draws a line from the point where sides A and B meet to to the hypotenuse C,
such&nbsp; that the line is perpendicular to C, the result is three triangles
that are in proportion to each other: the original large triangle and the two
inner ones. As shown on the diagram, for any two of these, the ratio of the the
longer side to the hypotenuse is the same; also, the ratio of the shorter side
to the hypotenuse is the same. The resulting equations can be manipulated to
prove Pythagoras' theorem.</p>
