<p>VECTORS AND MATRICES</p>

<p>In this document, multiplication is indicated by a star (*) and division is
indicated by a slash (/). This is done because the x-style multiplication sign
and dash with two dots for divide are not available in most computer character
fonts.</p>

<p>A &quot;vector&quot; is like an arrow flying in a certain
direction, with a head, a tail, and a magnitude (length). In a two-dimensional
world, such as&nbsp; a map, a vector can be represented on paper as an arrow.
The arrow length can represent some variable such as length or velocity. A
series of vectors can thus represent a path taken on the ground, or the
directions and velocity of a traveling vehicle.&nbsp;Mathematically, a vector is usually represented by a name
topped with a short horizontal bar that is sometimes
followed by a set of n value &quot;elements&quot; in square brackets. The elements can be either numeric values or variable
expressions. The &quot;dimension&quot; of the vector is n, the number of
elements. In the text of this document, the bar over the vector name is skipped
because it is not printable in the letter font. Some examples for a
three-dimensional vector are as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;A[6,7 9]&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;B[ i, j, k]&nbsp; &nbsp; C[3, k+m, 17]&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each element denotes a displacement in an n-dimensional reference space: for
example, for two dimensions, the horizontal and vertical directions on a graph
or the east and north directions on a map. The vector notation does not necessarily specify the location of a vector in
the reference space. It just specifies the x and y differences from the head to the tail.</p>

<p>TWO-DIMENSIONAL VECTORS</p>

<p>If&nbsp; n=2, the elements are the length
in the x direction and the length in the y direction, where x and y are are perpendicular to each other. Certain vector calculations can
be performed on two-dimensional vectors. The next illustration shows two cases
to demonstrate these calculations.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="triangles.jpg" width="256" height="202"></p>

<p>VECTOR ADDITION: In Case 1, to add&nbsp; vector B to A, the tail of B is
placed at&nbsp; the head of A and that results in vector C.&nbsp; Mathematically, each element of B is added to the corresponding element of A and is placed
into the corresponding element of C, as follows:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="VectAdd.jpg" width="168" height="111"></p>

<p>VECTOR SUBTRACTION : Similar to addition, but the elements of B are
subtracted from the elements of A.</p>

<p>VECTOR MAGNITUDE: Case 1 also shows that the components of C are x=3 and y=4
and these are at right angles to each other. In accordance with the Pythagorian
relationship, vector C is the hypotenuse of a right triangle and the square of
the hypotenuse is equal to the square of the sum of the other two sides.&nbsp;
Thus,&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="Mag.jpg" width="218" height="110"></p>

<p>For case 1,&nbsp; |C| = square root of&nbsp; 3x3 + 4x4&nbsp; =&nbsp; 5</p>

<p>Case 2 shows a case of vector addition for which the triangle is not a right
angle. This can be used to develop the formula for finding the length&nbsp;of
the third side of a triangle when the other two sides are known:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="ThirdSide.jpg" width="552" height="414"></p>

<p>VECTOR SCALAR OR DOT PRODUCT&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another procedure that produces a numerical value is the &quot;scalar
product&quot; but is often called the &quot;dot product&quot; because it is
represented&nbsp; by placing a dot between two vector names. Case 2 of the
previous illustration shows two vectors A and B with an angle theta between
them. The dot product is formed by multiplying each element of A by the
corresponding element of B and adding the results together. The result&nbsp; is
equal to the magnitude of A multiplied by the magnitude of B multiplied by the
cosine of the angle between A and B. This is useful when something is being designed
and there is a need to know the angle between two straight pieces. One can form
the dot product, divide it by both the magnitude of A and B, then look up the
angle in a table of cosines.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="Dot.jpg" width="670" height="296"></p>

<p>THREE-DIMENSIONAL VECTORS</p>

<p>We live in a three-dimensional world. Three-dimensional vectors are useful
for many tasks, such as guiding aircraft, creating 3-D displays and model objects for 3-D
printers. Three-dimensional vectors can be added or subtracted and the magnitude
can be calculated by using the same methods used for the two-dimensional ones,
except that the value of &quot;n&quot; is 3. Also, in 3-D there is another
mathematical operation called the &quot;cross product&quot;. The input for that
operation is two vectors. Any two vectors A and B not pointing in the same
direction establish a flat &quot;plane&quot; between them. The operation creates
a third vector C that is perpendicular to that plane. The direction of C is away
from one side of the plane or the other, depending upon whether the operation is performed on
A followed by B, or on B followed by A. The magnitude of the third vector is
|A|*|B|*sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the vectors.&nbsp;The following diagram can be used as an aid to remembering
how to calculate the cross product.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="VectCross.jpg" width="614" height="361"></p>

<p>The cross product is useful in designing, displaying and 3-D printing
three-dimensional objects. The skin of the object is represented as covered with
small triangles. Each triangle is represented by three points that provide data
for vectors. If the points are specified in a counter-clockwise order, the cross
product vector for the triangle points to the inside of the object; otherwise,
to the outside, During a 3-D display, the triangles having cross-product vectors
pointing away from the viewer are on the far side of the object and thus are not
visible.</p>

<p>N-DIMENSIONAL VECTORS</p>

<p>A column or row of n numbers can be treated as a vector. For example, solving
a set of simultaneous equations for 10 variables involves multiplying, adding
and subtracting what amounts to 10-dimensional vectors. For that application,
not only rows of values but also columns of values are treated as vectors. Many
operations on matrices involved steps involving rows and columns treated as
vectors.</p>

<p>The vector add, subtract, magnitude and dot product operations for vectors of
more than dimension 3 are similar to those for dimensions 2 and 3-- just more
terms to handle. One difference is that the &quot;cosine of the angle
between&quot; is called the &quot;correlation coefficient&quot;. It is equal to
1 if the two vectors are identical or multiples of each other; if they are not
and the coefficient is 0, the two vectors are said to be &quot;orthogonal&quot;
to each other, which is hard to imagine but is of great use when performing
experiments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>IN REVIEW</p>

<p>Some additional diagrams are presented here to help the reader remember the
rules for vector addition, subtraction, magnitude and dot product. These rules
are for n-dimensional vectors, whether n=2 or 3 or larger.</p>

<p>MATRICES</p>
<p>A matrix is a rectangular array of values with m horizontal rows and n
vertical columns, where m and n are integers. Matrices are useful for performing
many calculations such as the solving of simultaneous equations, plotting
contours, creating data for 3-D displays and 3-D printing, forecasting the
weather and simulating aircraft flights. The symbol for a matrix consists of a
name. Sometimes, the name is surrounded by square brackets, as follows: [A]. When accessing an element
of a matrix, the matrix name is used followed
by two integer indices in square brackets, as follows: A[2,5]. The indices refer to the row number
(top row = 1) and the column number (left column = 1) of the element. </p>
<p>There are some mathematical procedures that can be performed on matrices:</p>
<p>MATRIX TRANSPOSE</p>
<p>Matrix transpose is used to convert an m by n matrix into an n by m matrix,
denoted by a letter in brackets and a superscript T</p>
<p><img border="0" src="MatTransp.jpg" width="822" height="499"></p>
<p>MATRIX MULTIPLY </p>
<p>C = A * B,&nbsp; where A is of dimensions x by y, B is of dimensions y by z
and C is x by z. Each horizontal row of matrix A and each vertical column of B
is treated as a vector of dimension y; the resultant C is x by z. Each element
of of the resultant C is the vector dot product of a particular combination of a
row of A and a column of B, as shown below for A of dimension 6 by 4 and for B
of dimension 4 by 5. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
C </p>
<p><img border="0" src="MatMult.jpg" width="848" height="372"></p>
<p>SQUARE MATRICES</p>
<p>There are some special versions of matrices that are square. The &quot;diagonal&quot; matrix consists of all 0's except for values in the diagonal elements from [1,1] to
[n,n]. A &quot;unity&quot; matrix is a diagonal matrix with all 1's in the diagonal. A
&quot;tri-diagonal&quot; is like the diagonal but has values on either side of
each diagonal element. Examples for 5 by 5&nbsp; matrices are as follows: </p>
<p><img border="0" src="Diagonals.jpg" width="255" height="304">&nbsp; </p>
<p>SQUARE MATRIX OPERATIONS</p>
<p>Square matrices are used in many mathematical procedures. One operation that
is a part of most of these procedures is to reduce the matrix to a unit matrix
by performing the following row operations: multiply all elements in a row by a
constant, add or subtract elements of a row from those of another row or
interchange rows. One example of a reduction procedure is as follows:</p>
<p>For each row i,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Divide all elements in the row by the &quot;pivot&quot; element A(i,i).
This leaves the pivot at 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp; For each other row j,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determine a multiplier V from element A(j,i)
that is in the same column as the pivot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subtract V times each element of the pivot row
from the corresponding element of row j. This zeroes out the element A(j,i).</p>
<p>&nbsp; End of row j operations.</p>
<p>End of row i operations.</p>
<p>The next diagram illustrates some square matrix procedures.</p>
<p>MATRIX INVERSE</p>
<p>The &quot;inverse&quot; of an n by n matrix is different from the transpose
of A. The inverse is a matrix such that, if A is multiplied by the inverse of A,
the result is the unit matrix I, as shown in the first area of the next diagram.
The method of finding the inverse is shown in the second area of the diagram. A
unit matrix is appended to the right of A then row operations are performed to
reduce A to a unit I matrix; however, the n row operations are performed upon
the entire combination of A and I. The result is that the original A matrix
becomes a unit matrix and the original unit matrix becomes the inverse of A.</p>

<p>Some samples of 3 by 3 matrices and their inverses:</p>

<p>| 1&nbsp; -1&nbsp; -1
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
|&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp; -1
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
| 1&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; 0
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
| 1&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 |&nbsp;</p>

<p>| -1&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inverse =&nbsp; |&nbsp;
7&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp; -2
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
| 3&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inverse =&nbsp;
|-3&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 |</p>

<p>| 1&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp; 4
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
| -3&nbsp; -2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
| 4&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp; 1
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
|11&nbsp; -5&nbsp; -1|</p>

<p>SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS</p>

<p>If one is provided by n equations in n independent variables, there is a
convenient matrix method of solving them. For example, for three variables A B
and C, one would set up a matrix and an n-vector as follows:</p>

<p>6*A + 5*B + 12*C =
42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
6&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp; 12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 42</p>

<p>4*A + 3*B + 10*C = 30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-----&gt;&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; 30&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>5*A + 6*B + 11*C =
56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp; 11&nbsp;&nbsp; 56</p>

<p>As shown in the third area of the diagram, the square of&nbsp; left-side
values X is appended to the right by the vector Y of right-side values. To solve
the system, n row operations are performed on the combined n by n+1 matrix to
reduce the X part to a unit I matrix. The resulting values of the Y vector will
then be the answers for variables A, B and C.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="SquareMatOps.jpg" width="600" height="600"></p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p>CORRELATION</p>
<p>When some square matrix operations are performed on a computer, a problem may
occur when one row is a multiple or equal of another. For example, for a set of
simultaneous equations, one such row can be multiplied then subtracted from the
other and the system would then have a zero row and the problem would be
unsolvable. A similar problem may occur if a row or column is almost a multiple
of another. This may causes a numeric overflow an attempt to form a number that
is too large to represent in the computer's system. An attempt to find the
inverse of such a matrix will fail. Such a matrix is called
&quot;singular&quot;, which is another way of saying it is bad.</p>
</font>
<p>To check for these conditions, we can calculate the &quot;correlation
coefficient&quot; for each combination of two columns. As was explained in the
VECTOR discussions of this document, the dot product of
two vectors of dimension two or three produces a result of |A|*|B|*cos(theta),
where theta is the angle between them. When the dot product of two vectors of
dimension greater than three is formed, the result is considered to be
|A|*|B|*cc, where cc is the correlation coefficient. Like the cosine, the value
ranges from 0 to 1. If the value is 1, the two vectors are multiples or equals of each
other; if the value is 0, they are said to be &quot;orthogonal&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If one performs experiments involving several X values, it is
advisable to form an m by n matrix for which m is the
number of experiments and n is the number of&nbsp; different X variables. One can
then multiply the transpose of X by X then divide each
element by the absolute values of the columns to give a matrix of correlation
coefficients, as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="dotmats1.jpg" width="350" height="160"></p>

<p>For some procedures such as the solution of simultaneous equations, the
coefficients on the diagonal should be the value 1 and the other elements should
be less&nbsp; than one. For a perfect case, in which all of the X column vectors
are orthogonal to each other, the n by n matrix and the correlation matrix would
be as follows:</p>

<font FACE="Times New Roman" LANG="JA">
<p><img border="0" src="dotmats2.jpg" width="350" height="150"></p>

<p>VECTOR&nbsp; ROTATION</p>
<p>The rules for rotating a vector by an angle theta assume that the X-Y-Z coordinate system is in
accordance with the &quot;right-hand rule&quot;. The cross-product of the X axis
and the Y axis should result in a Z axis vector. In other words, if a person
holds up a right hand, points the thumb up and curves the fingers as to move the
X axis to the Y,&nbsp; the thumb will point up to represent Z. For example, X
could point east, Y then would point south and Z would point upward.</p>
<p>In two dimensions, vector rotation by an angle theta is accomplished by
multiplying the vector by the first matrix shown below. For three dimensions, rotation
about axis X, Y or Z one would use the second, third or fourth matrix below.
Rotation to some intermediate position can be accomplished by performing more
than one of the multiplications sequentially.</p>
