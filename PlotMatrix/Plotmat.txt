PLOTMATRIX

The PLOTMATRIX program can be used to display line-graphs formed by connecting a series of x,y points. 

The advantages are:
The input file format is simple and can be generated by a number of progams, including Basic, Notepad, and some versions of Excel..
The resulting graph is automatically scaled to fit an 8 1/2" by 11" sheet in the "landscape" mode.
A horizontal and a vertical text title can be added to the graph.

The input for the program is a text (.TXT) file containing values separated by commas. This format is called the "matrix" format, and the plotting program is a member of a set of matrix programs for adding, multiplying, inverting matrices, etc.

The first line of a matrix file contains two values M and N, with the value M indicating the number of rows (lines) and N specifying the number of columns. This is followed with M rows of values, with each line containing N values.

For example, for a 4 by 3 matrix:

4, 3
1,        3,      5
7,      2.4,     5.7
13.3,  6.4,     8
19,    19.5,   7.5

(blank spaces are ignored)

The program can plot more than one line-plot simultaneously.When used with the PLOTMATRIX, the first column of the input contains x-values. The second column are the corresponding y-values for the first line-plot, the third column are y-values for the second line-plot, etc. 

Because the program draws lines sequentially from point to point, the rows for each plot should be sorted in order of increasing x values. There are some exceptions to this: for example, for a polar plot or a plot representing a polygon, the points should proceed clockwise or counterclockwise, to result in the drawing of the figure.

Several plotable matrix files are provided. One called "sincos.txt" was generated from an Excel spreadsheet. The matrix values were copied by highlighting them nd selecting COPY from the menu. Next, the Notepad program was started and a PASTE was performed to produce the matrix .txt file.
