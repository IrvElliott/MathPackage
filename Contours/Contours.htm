<p class="Standard">CONTOURS</p>

<p class="Standard">Contour lines provide a means of showing a third dimension
on a two-dimensional graph. For example, a map of an area may show lines that
each pass through points of equal altitude. Thus, if the area contains hills, the map could have contour lines for every
100 feet of elevation. The
lines around each hill would appear as a set of concentric loops. An example
is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p class="Standard">Contours can be used to represent many different variables;
for example, temperatures, heights, air pressure, population density, and votes
cast by different political parties. The U. S. Weather Bureau uses maps showing
air pressure to track storms and to determine wind speed and thus to aid in
forecasting the weather. A variation that is used on television is the weather
map covered with colored areas with each area representing a different range of temperatures or inches of snow or rain. For these, each area between contour
lines is shown in a different color. For example, a blue color might be used
between the temperature contour lines for degrees 0 and 10 degrees.<o:p>

<p class="Standard">GENERATION OF CONTOUR LINES<o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="Standard"><o:p>
The first step in forming a contoured diagram is to have a two-dimensional
diagram or map and to have a set of points for which the value of each is known.
If a computer is to be used, the location of each point can be specified by x and y and the
value of the point by v.<o:p>

One method that was once used by cartographers to obtain the height values for
maps was to mount a camera in an airplane and to fly over an area in a path that
consists of overlapping strips of land, as shown in the next illustration. The
camera was built to have a rolling spool of film driven by a motor that was
synchronized to the speed of the aircraft. The plane was carefully controlled to
maintain a constant altitude. Objects in the overlapped region were then seen in
both a left and a right view, as in a stereograph. In a lab, the resulting
strips were placed side by side and examined by a person using an instrument
that resembled a microscope but had two eyepieces and a rolling base. The device
could be rolled above a pair of images and adjusted to make the two views of the
top of the object appear to coincide. The plane’s altitude, object spacing and
instrument setting would then be used to compute the height of the object. Thus,
it was possible not only to measure the height of land features such as hills,
but also the height of telephone poles and buildings. </p>
<p class="Standard" align="center"><img border="0" src="Aerial.jpg" width="550" height="392"></p>
<p class="Standard" align="left">Nowadays, the task is much simpler because the
plane can have an altimeter radar that measures the distance to the ground and
is connected to a GPS device and a digital recorder. <o:p>
</p>
<p>When generating a contoured diagram, it is necessary to select a set of
contour values chosen such that the range extends over the measured point value
range. Preferably, these values should be separated equally by a &quot;contour
interval&quot;. For example, if the point value range is 34 thorough 98 a good
set of contour values would be 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100.</p>
<p>MANUAL GENERATION OF CONTOURS</p>
<p>A manual method of generating the contour lines would be, for each contour
value, locate pairs of points that have values above and below the value and
draw a line between the points. For each pair of points, one should space the
distance of the line from each point proportionally. For example, for two points
of values 22 and 54, the line for v=30 should be placed one-fourth of the
distance from the 22 point, according to the following calculation:</p>
<p>(30-22) / (54-22) = ¼</p>
<p>THE EQUAL-SQUARE METHOD</p>
<p>One method of generating contour lines on a computer is to divide the diagram
into equal squares and then to estimate or calculate the values of each line
intersection: i.e., each corner of each square. Next, for each contour value,
the four sides of each square are examined to determine if the contour value is
within the range of the values on the two points on the ends of the side. If the
contour value is within the range of two or more sides, they are then connected
by a line or lines. Figure 3 illustrates the procedure for one square.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Square.jpg" width="305" height="254"></p>
<p>This method is recommended if the values of all corner points can be measured
or expressed mathematically. The resulting contour lines are somewhat
jagged and, if used on a map, should be redrawn by curving each line as it
passes from one side to an adjacent side of a square. Figure 4 shows contour
lines for a surface representing waves in a pan of water. The values for each
corner point were computer-generated by using mathematical equations that
simulated waves. The contours were formed by the equal-square method..</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Waves.jpg" width="373" height="347"></p>
<p>In structured dialog, the procedure for generating the contour lines in this
manner is as follows:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="StrucCode.jpg" width="560" height="279"></p>
<p>The method will also work if the area is divided into rectangles or triangles
of equal size and the third variable is known for each corner of the rectangle
or triangle.</p>
<p>RANDOM-POINT METHOD</p>
<p>If the surface represented by the graph has randomly spaced points
representing measurements, the computer generation of contour lines is more
difficult. An example of this case is a weather map with contours or colored
areas for different temperature ranges. The data for such a chart may be, for
example, temperatures called in by volunteer weather spotters living in towns
located throughout a state. Figure 5 is an example of an area with
points representing towns. Each point is marked with a temperature value.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Figure5.jpg" width="423" height="366"></p>
<p align="left">A contoured diagram of this sort can be formed by using a method
borrowed from theoretical physics. For example, if one hangs up a sheet of iron
and then attaches small, thermostatically controlled heaters to it at various
points, the sheet will start to heat. Each place that touches one of the heaters
will stay at the regulated temperature of the neighboring heater; the
temperature for these will be &quot;fixed&quot;. The other places on the sheet
will be &quot;variable&quot; and will start to heat in proportion to the average
temperatures around it. After a while, the temperatures throughout the sheet
will quit changing; the process will reach &quot;equilibrium&quot;. The
mathematical procedure for simulating this is called &quot;relaxation&quot;. One can
explain the process mathematically with Poisson’s equation:</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="Poisson.jpg" width="237" height="173">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="Standard">This equation essentially states that the rate of changes in
incremental differences in temperature in both the x and y directions gradually
decreases to zero.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If we consider
three incremental points in the x direction, the difference between P2 and P1 is
P2 - P1. The difference between P3 and P2 is P3 – P2. The change in the
difference between (P2-P1) and (P3-P2) is (P3-P2) - (P2-P1), and at equilibrium,
that expression is equal to zero.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
formula can be re-expressed as P2 = (P1 + P3)/2. In other words, at equilibrium,
the middle point is the average of the two adjacent points. If we also consider
points in the y direction, we can extend the formula to show that, at
equilibrium, any variable point is at a temperature equal to the average of the
four points around it.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="Standard"><o:p>
If we map the points on a fairly detailed matrix, as in the previous square
diagram, and assign the points to the nearest line intersections, we can then
treat the problem as the heated sheet of iron and wait for equilibrium. Then we
will have reasonable values for all line intersections! The Figure 3 example was
mapped onto a 100 by 100 element matrix having 10,000 line intersections.
Each element containing a fixed value was biased such that it was negative and
thus was recognizable as fixed; the variable elements were biased to be positive. A
loop was performed 3000 times to change the value of each variable element to
the average value of the four elements surrounding it. The resulting values were
quantized into ranges between contour values and displayed in different colors.
The outer boundary of each colored region is thus a contour line. Figure 7 has
three views of the process: an early view, an intermediate view and the final
equilibrium view.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="Standard">The relaxation process is used by meteorologists. A map with
contours showing air pressure is converted to a matrix and the relaxation
procedure provides an aid to forecasting the weather. Relaxation can also be
used to study growth patterns of microbes or population trends. The method can
also be extended to three-dimensional space and be used to study chemical
reactions and to design nuclear reactors.<o:p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="Standard">ACCURACY
</p>
<p class="Standard">Both the manual and computerized methods assume positions
for the placement of contour lines between points. The degree of accuracy
depends upon the number of points and the spacing between them. For example,
Bryce Canyon in Utah has many tall, pointed rocks that are shaped like the
Washington Monument. If one makes a squared grid for generating a contoured map
of the park, any tall rock that lies entirely within a square will be ignored by
the process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span><o:p>
