<P>FLIGHT SIMULATION</P>
<P>One application of vectors and matrices is the simulation of the flight of an
 aircraft or spacecraft. For this, the programmer has to set up two X-Y-Z
 coordinate systems:&nbsp; a global X Y Z system for the flying space and a local
x y z system for the aircraft. The global system is used to record the craft's position in
 space. The local system is used to specify the shape of the craft and to 
control its roll, pitch and yaw. Control can be either automatic or by manual 
input. The simulation can be converted to into a real-time two or three
 dimensional display. </P>
<P>The shape of the aircraft must be specified by a number of local system
 points on the "skin" of the craft; e.g., one for the craft nose, one for the 
tail, one on each wing tip, etc. A refinement would be to specify lines between 
the points such that the resulting triangles or squares would specify small 
areas that make up the skin of the craft. One important addition is a 
velocity vector, from the tail to the nose. That vector would indicate
 the global X Y Z flight direction and magnitude of the velocity. The local origin should be
 at the center of rotation of the craft (center of the wing for an airplane), 
the x pointing to the right, the y pointing straight ahead and the z upward. 
This satisfies the "right-hand rule" used for implementing rotations. The global 
X-Y-Z system would be similar: e.g., X to the east, Y north and Z upward. </P>
<P>A timing system "clock" variable should cause periodical input of control 
parameters from the "pilot" (automatic or manual). These would then alter the 
craft's roll, pitch, yaw and velocity and that would result in local system 
vector rotations and velocity magnitude changes. The local system information 
would then be transferred to the global system by adding the local coordinates 
to a vector extending from the global origin to the craft's global position.
Roll is the change in the x-z angle, pitch is the y-z angle change and yaw is
the x-y change.</P>
<P>If&nbsp; the craft is a helicopter, two more coordinate systems would be
 necessary: one for the top rotor and another for the tail rotor. The points and
 lines representing the blades would be rotated, using vector rotations, and 
added to the craft's local coordinates. Also, another coordinate system could be
included to display three-dimensional scenery, such as trees, buildings and mountains.
 The scenery display could be&nbsp; made to change as the craft moved.</P>
<P>Other refinements: One would be to have the boundary points of each
 square or triangle on the craft specified in the same (counter-clockwise) order
 so that the display could use vector cross-products to form &quot;normal
vectors&quot; from them to determine if the element of the surface is facing
 towards or away from the viewer. For example, if the X axis points to the
viewer, each triangle having a normal vector with a positive X component would
be facing the viewer and thus could then be filled
 with color. Ones facing away would not be displayed. Another feature would be to have
 the magnitudes of all displayed items adjusted larger or smaller,
 depending upon the simulated distance away from the viewer.</P>
<P>PURSUIT AND ANTI-COLLISION CONTROL</P>
<P>This section describes the method of controlling an aircraft to chase
another, usually for a friendly craft to get close enough to fire guns or a
missile at an enemy. Instinct tells us that the friendly craft should just point
toward the enemy craft and speed ahead. This would be like a bulldog chasing a
cat; the dog would follow an unnecessarily curved path. A better way would be to
head for a &quot;lead&quot; point ahead of the enemy. The control method causes
this to happen.</P>
<P>The primary requirement is that the friendly aircraft must be faster than the
enemy. The following diagram illustrates a typical chase in just two dimensions.
The progressive &quot;bearing angles&quot; (global X Y angles) between the two crafts are indicated by
numbered lines starting with 1. Each line is for one time increment. The control
method is based upon the fact that, if these craft are to arrive together in the
shortest time, the angle between them should not change. At each point in time,
the pilot notes how the global bearing angle between the crafts is changing,
clockwise or counter-clockwise. If so, the pilot changes the plane's direction
the same way by an angle that is equal to the bearing angle change. Soon,
the bearing angle is no longer changing and the two crafts meet.</P>

<P>The theory behind the control method can also be used to avoid collisions. If
the bearing angle between two crafts is not changing, the two are destined to
collide. To avoid collision, one pilot or both must change speed or direction
such that the bearing
angle changes.&nbsp; </P>
<P>A refinement used to design a device for automatically controlling collisions in
space is to extend the method to three dimensions. The calculations for the
control algorithm then involves three-dimensional vector arithmetic. The bearing
angles are then calculated by using the vector cross product and the adjustments
to the friendly aircraft are made by adding vectors. </P>
