<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This document describes some programming tasks that I have encountered in the
past. Back in the late 1940's, I graduated with a degree in Chemical
Engineering. My first job was in a battery factory. There, employees were
getting lead poisoning. I would wear a new pair of jeans to work and by evening,
they would be full of acid holes. I heard that Engineering Research Associates,
in St. Paul, was building giant computers, so I went there to apply. Because I
had some army experience in electronics and in writing articles for the
University of Minnesota's &quot;Technolog&quot; magazine, I received a job in
the publication department. At that time, a typical computer filled a small
auditorium with 7-foot tall cabinets and a 45 horsepower blower to cool the
vacuum tubes. They said that I could write
instruction books telling people how to maintain and program the computers. I
replied that I didn't now anything about computers and they told me,
&quot;Neither does anyone else!&quot; After a few years, I switched jobs. The
company was developing a new computer and I became a programmer on the project.
At that time, all programs were written in octal machine code. I wrote a number
of utility routines for that project.</p>
<p>Some of the employees left to form Control Data Corporation. Their specialty
was building large-scale computers. I took a job with them and my first task was
to write an assembler that allowed customers to write programs in coding that
resembled IBM's assembly language. At that time, Fortran was introduced to the
world, so I also wrote a Fortran compiler. At that time, that compiler was the
world's fastest; many times faster than Big Blue's. The Association for
Computing Machinery started publishing algorithms in a language called Algol.
Control Data hired a pair of programmers to write an Algol compiler. Years have
passed, and Algol has fallen by the wayside.</p>
<p>A friend of mine &quot;jumped ship&quot;; he and some other engineers formed
a small company that designed a transistorized computer that needed no air conditioning. He convinced me that the
design was a winner, so I joined his company. There, I wrote them an assembler
and a Fortran compiler. We were all going to get rich! Unfortunately, the
company went bankrupt after a year.</p>
<p>I applied for a job at Honeywell. At that time, they had a giant digital
computer and a large analog computer. In general, programming was performed by a
programming department. Engineers were supposed to ask the programmers to code
for them. The computers were used to simulate aircraft controls. For a while, I worked on digital programs to solve
differential equations. The company bought a small company that built
breadbox-sized computers and wanted to use them to control measurement devices
that were used to test aircraft instruments. I became involved with that; I
wrote a primitive operating system that allowed a number of the smaller
computers to act as a network of testers. Because the systems were used at
airports and factories throughout the country, I often traveled to customer
sites where most computing was done in assembly language or non-structured
Fortran for IBM machines. The method of writing a program was to make flow charts,
then to implement the task by using many &quot;go to&quot; statements. I attended a
lecture on structured programming and became &quot;hooked&quot; on the
structured concept. I wrote a program called &quot;SPTRAN&quot; that allowed one
to write structured programs with no flow charts and with no go-to statements.
This program would convert the programs into the non-structured form. This
caught on and the engineering staff started to use it to write their own programs. </p>
<p>The testing of aircraft controls and of other devices became a global task. A
committee designed an ATLAS language for that purpose. The language was
specified in BNF&nbsp; (Backus-Naur-Format) notation. This is a notation that is
used to represent the structure of a language. Perhaps you can remember a
teacher asking you to &quot;diagram&quot; a sentence by showing the verb, the
noun, the adjectives, etc. The BNF notation can do that, but uses only the
characters found on a keyboard instead of using a chart with words and lines. There were many pages
of BNF; however, there was no compiler for the language. One day, I was walking
my dog and had the thought: &quot;Those fellows&nbsp; that wrote the Algol
compiler included the BNF for the language into their compiler. Their program
traveled through the BNF like a person walking in a maze while scanning the
source code like reading a road map.. Whenever the path fit a
section of the input coding, their program would drop off pieces of the
equivalent machine code.&quot; When I returned to work, I wrote an interpreter
that entered the ATLAS BNF like a maze and dropped off assembly language for our
computer.&nbsp;As a result, we had a compiler that was rather small and ran
fast. Subsequently, I used&nbsp; the same scheme to write a special-purpose
compiler for a weapons system. That method of writing a compiler is
described&nbsp; in this document, in the COMPILER section. </p>
<p>So, after 35 years in the&nbsp; computer business, I retired. I was
privileged to see the birth of many marvelous things. At Univac, Jack Hill took
a wheel the size of an auto tire and covered it with a new product called
&quot;magnetic tape&quot;. He added read/write heads and thus invented the first
magnetic storage device; that eventually involved into the magnetic disk. Vacuum
tubes were replaced with small transistors which were replaced later with small
dots of silicon or germanium on a chip. Some of the first computers were 40 feet
long; today, you can buy one that fits on your wrist.&nbsp; Years ago, people
calculated with a hand-cranked calculator; now, cell phones are thousands of
times smarter than the computer that guided men to the moon. </p>
