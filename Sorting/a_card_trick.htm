<p>A CARD TRICK</p>
<p>This trick requires a deck of cards that, when placed face-down, has been
sorted so that the top four cards are aces, the next are four twos, etc. through
four kings on the bottom. There should be 52 cards; no joker! The magician then
holds the deck sideways in one hand and says that he/she is going to shuffle
them. Next, the magician does several false cuts by taking about half the back
side of the deck from the top, sliding it over then underneath and placing it
underneath in the back. Thus, the original order is preserved. </p>
<p>Next, the magician says, &quot;Now I am going to re-arrange the deck!&quot;
and blows on the cards. Next, starting with the top card, he repeatedly deals a
card onto a table and spells one letter for each card, as shown in the table
below. On each letter except the last letter of each line, he deals a card face
down and calls out the letter. On the last letter of each line, he deals the
card face-up and loudly calls out the last letter of the line.</p>
<p>A C E<br>
T W O<br>
T H R E E<br>
F O U R<br>
F I V E<br>
S I X<br>
S E V E N<br>
E I G H T<br>
NINE<br>
TEN<br>
&nbsp;JACK<br>
QUEEN<br>
KING</p>
<p>Notice that there are 52 characters in the table. Magically, the card turned
up with the last letter of each line will be the a card with the name that was
just spelled.</p>
