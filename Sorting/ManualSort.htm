<p>A MANUAL SORT</p>
<p>A manual sort procedure described here can be used to sort items such as
recipe cards, sales receipts, photographs, etc. It is useful if one has a large
number of items to sort but has limited table space. The method is the same as
that used in the Four-Tape-Sort, described in a different chapter. The following description
was written to show how to manipulate a shuffled deck of playing cards such that it is
in sorted order aces through kings. One would do that in preparation of a
certain magic trick described in another section. The method requires table space for four stacks of
cards, as follows:</p>
<p>C&nbsp; D</p>
<p>A&nbsp; B</p>
<p>The method consists of an &quot;initial pass&quot; followed by one or more
&quot;merge passes&quot;. In the initial pass, a shuffled deck of cards is&nbsp; placed
face-up onto
position A. The cards from A are examined one at a time. If a card from A is
equal or stronger in face value than the card on C, or if C is blank, it is
placed face-up on C. Putting the equal or larger A cards onto C is repeated
until an A card smaller than the C card is found. When that happens, the
procedure switches so that the A cards equal or greater than the D card, or if
space D is blank, are placed upon
D. If an A card is smaller than the D card, the procedure switches back to
putting A cards on C. Thus, the
procedure alternates between covering C and D and that results in short sub-sequences on C and
D that are sorted. The average length of a sub-sequence during the initial pass is about two or
three cards. The initial pass flow chart is shown on a subsequent page.</p>
<p>To start the merge pass, the stacks with the sorted sequences are
placed face-up onto A and B. The cards on A and B are now the cards
picked up and placed upon C and D. First, both A and B are compared to the stack
C card.
If only one is equal or larger than the C card, or if C is blank, it is placed on C. If both A and B are
both equal or larger, A is compared to B and the smaller one is placed on C. If
neither A nor B is equal or greater than C, card A is placed upon D and the
procedure switches to placing A and B cards that are greater or equal to D upon D. As it is
done in the initial pass, the procedure alternates between placing cards upon C
and D. When all the A and C cards are placed, the C and D stacks contain sorted
sub-sequences that are twice as long as the ones that came from A and B. The
merge pass is repeated back and forth on the table until all cards are on one stack. At that point, the deck
will be in sorted order with aces at the bottom and kings on top. The flow charts for both passes are
shown on the next two pages. </p>
<p>VARIATIONS </p>
<p>If one has more room, a larger number of spaces can be used. For example, the
initial pass could distribute cards to four stacks; thus, fewer merge passes would
be necessary. Another variation would be to perform alternate initial sorts and
merges. For example, distribute just a portion of the
initial deck, do a merge pass, then repeat the initial pass for some remaining
position A
cards and more merges on the rest of the cards, then merge all of the resulting piles. </p>
<p>If one has a collection of items that are already sorted, such as photographs
sorted by date, and some newer unsorted photos, one could use a mixed approach.
One could first do the initial sort pass on the new ones, then do merge passes on the
initial ones and the sorted ones.&nbsp; </p>
